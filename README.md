If you have the latest version (v1.0.3) of the update.bat, simply open it and it will update itself (You'll see it show "Checking Extras Repository for updates to update.bat..." at the top)

If you do not have the latest version, you can get it Here -> [Update.bat](https://github.com/Deadlineem/Extras-Addon-for-YimMenu/blob/main/update.bat)

## TIPS:

1. When you're in YimMenu/GTA, go to Settings > Lua Scripts and Check the box to Automatically Update Scripts, it will get changes as soon as a new change is made.

2. Settings > GUI > Show Overlay (Uncheck this to hide the menu completely when you press Insert).
