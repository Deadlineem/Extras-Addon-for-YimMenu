  -       Money -> YimCEO sourced from Alestarov_Menu
  -       Drops -> Sourced from Ultimate Menu by L7Neg modified to run in a loop on click

- Currently Planned Features:
-     Vehicle Gifting - Working on it
      Health Options - Not really sure if i want these, placeholder for now unless i have some idead for it.
      Teleport Options - Just a placeholder, but thinking about having something like your own personal buildings for options.  Dropdown selectable, click cutton teleport.
      Vehicle Modifications - Id love to have some 1 click mod types on the fly, like something to instantly upgrade cars to the max with benny's wheels or F1 wheels.  Maybe dropdowns to select the type of wheels specifically in bennys or F1 selections??
      Spawn/Delete - This will probably be labeled something different later, Basically, the options will consist of quick vehicle options that work, like saving vehicles to a json file or cloning the nearest car to spawn it later, things of that nature.
